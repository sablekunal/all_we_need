# Why It's Great
Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) stands out with its incredibly generous "Always Free" Arm compute instances, which are powerful enough to run substantial workloads forever, not just for 12 months.

# Key Free Tier Features

## 💻 Compute
- **Arm Ampere A1**: Up to 4 OCPUs and 24GB RAM (Always Free).
- **AMD Compute**: 2 VMs with 1/8 OCPU and 1GB RAM each.
- **Load Balancer**: 1 instance with 10Mbps bandwidth.

## 🗄️ Storage & Networking
- **Block Volume**: 200GB total storage (Always Free).
- **Object Storage**: 10GB Standard.
- **Outbound Data**: 10TB per month (significantly higher than competitors).
- **Databases**: 2 Autonomous Databases (20GB each).

## 🔧 Monitoring & Security
- **Monitoring**: 500 million ingestion data points, 1 billion retrieval.
- **Notifications**: 1 million delivery options per month.

# Limitations
- Arm availability can sometimes be scarce in certain popular regions (e.g., Ashburn).
- Instances may be reclaimed if deemed idle for long periods (7 days of inactivity).
